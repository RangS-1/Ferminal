Ferminal or I like to call it **F*ck Terminal** is a lightweight, Python-based terminal made specifically for Windows users who are tired of typing long commands in Command Prompt or PowerShell.

Instead of writing long commands repeatedly, just use short **custom aliases** that you define yourself.

Examples:
- `d` → change directory
- `w` → working directory
- `k` → make directory
- `p` → clear terminal
- etc...
